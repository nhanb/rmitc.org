<p>Presentation has become an  indispensible part of most courses at RMIT. In order to support those &nbsp;presentations, you usually use Microsoft Power Point (PP) to make  slides. The repetition of PP slides has become more and more boring for  every student at the university. As a result, you need a new tool to  replace this product of Microsoft.</p>
<p>Prezi presents itself as a perfect  alternative in this case. It is automated, free, portable, easy and  more importantly fun to use. Three semesters ago, one group in PCP, a  course of IT program, achieved the highest mark when they used Prezi to  support their presentation. Mr. Quang Tran, a lecturer of IT department,  also encourages the use of Prezi in his classes. The automation of  Prezi shows makes presentations more interesting, and of course, removes  the sleepiness of the audience.</p>
<p>Realizing the need of students for this tool, IT Club will organize a series of Prezi workshop in week 3. There are three sessions, delivering the same content:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Session 1: 10.30am – 11.30am Tuesday 2nd&nbsp;November &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Room: 4.16</li>
  <li> Session 2: 9am – 10am Wednesday 3rd&nbsp;November &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Room: 1.15</li>
  <li> Session 3: 4pm – 5pm Wednesday 3rd&nbsp;November &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Room: 1.15</li>
</ul>
<p>You are able to join any of them, depending on your timetable. Moreover, we also provide you a fascinating competition at the end of each workshop, with quaint gifts for the winner.</p>
