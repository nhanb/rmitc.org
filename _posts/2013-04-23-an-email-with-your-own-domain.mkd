> So you have your own domain. What's next?

## part 1: an email with your own domain? that's easy!

Suddenly you have to exchange contact information with someone in the
industry. Then when it comes to email...

> My God! How could I give them this nickname "cuteboy..."? So embarrassing!

Okay this scenario is weird. How about another case: you give them an email of
*john.doe@techaction.com*. I personally think your thought would be like:

> Hehe! Couldn't they realize that's my name and my personal website on it? \*evil grin\*

Yes it's true! An email with your own domain is something that you **do** be proud of! But how do
you have one?

### Try Google Apps for Business, it's free!

For only one email address, yes, **only** **one**! But what you will have are priceless:
@your-domain.com email address, calendar, drives, sites, Google+ profile, and many awesome apps
that are **free** on Google Apps marketplace! If those amazing features are not convincing
(enough), these are also included:

-   25GB of inbox,
-   5GB Drive storage,
-   24/7 customer support for any issues,
-   So much more...

I'm using Google Apps to host my professional email
[luan@tklarryonline.me](mailto:luan@tklarryonline.me) and trust me, the value is greatly awesome
for just one free package! Nuff said, let's get started shall we?

### Signing up Google Apps for free

**Step 1**: Sign up for a personal Google account (a @gmail.com one). *I
don't have to guide you through this, right? Yet if you already have
one, skip to Step 2*

**Step 2**: Follow this link [https://appengine.google.com/](https://appengine.google.com/) with
your Google account and click on **Create Application**

**Step 3**: It will probably ask you for phone verification. Just type in your mobile phone number
in Vietnam, wait for the code and fill in the text-box to get this verification step done. Step 4:
You will be taken to this **Create an Application **form. Just fill in any random data in requested
fields, you may want to try some funky data to make it unique to pass the uniqueness test. Then
just click on **Create Application**.

**Congratulations**! You have basically finished everything needed to give you a **professional
email address with personal cool-looking domain**! But for now, your login URL for the Google Apps
Email (and other apps) is just https://mail.google.com/a/your-domain.com and still doesn't look
cool enough. Just play around, and stay tuned for the next part, as I will explain (with a little
bit advance stuff) how to

##### **Part 2: Easily personalize the Google Apps services URLs**.
