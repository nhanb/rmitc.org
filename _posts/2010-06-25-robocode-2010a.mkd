> There was an internal competition during the first semester of year 2010. Members of RMITC were introduced to the Robocode framework and
started writing robots to pitch them against each other on Wednesday
morning each week. Some members have a little prior experience with the
framework, so their robots ruled the battlefield initially. Later weeks
saw some intense actions as other members caught up, and as team brawls
and epic free-for-all clashes replaced one-on-one skirmishes. Some
formerly dominating robots were quickly fried amidst the chaos. As if it
was not fun enough, some members creatively added some "battle cries" to
their robots to stir up the vibes.

The tournament was not the only event. An enthusiastic student, Khang
Vo, began modifying the original framework, adding features like
power-ups (and power-downs), bullets that look like laser. This modified
framework was used for demonstration during Club Day of the second
semester, and is intended to be used for the coming competition as well.
