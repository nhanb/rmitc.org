> [Android](http://www.android.com/) is an opensource operating system for
mobile phones developed by Google. This operation system is supported by
many mobile phone manufacturers like HTC, Samsung, Motorola and Sony
Ericsson. Android is designed to help developers build applications
easily using Java and XML. When getting to know about Android, we - IT
students in RMIT will learn and improve our skills about Java, XML as
well as Software Engineering skills. That is one of many reasons that IT
club held the Android seminar in the last semester.

## What was the purposes of the seminar?

Apart from the reasons above, the seminar gave IT students some ideas
about the new mobile platform (Android) and helped them extend their
relationship within the IT community in RMIT. After this seminar, some
students "fell in love" with Android and decided to discover the Android
world deeper.
