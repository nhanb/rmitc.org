title: Viettel staff uses Ubuntu - Yes, they do !

> Ever since I was introduced to Ubuntu 5 years ago, I have sticked with
it and never go back. I guess I was lucky, as my first impression with
Ubuntu was flawless, it was so fresh that it blew me away.

However, the experience many had with Ubuntu are not as perfect. Take my
best friend as an example. His Windows XP set-up was screwed up so bad,
it was infected with a virus, and every now and then the virus plays a
short sample of "I Lay My Love on You" (the virus creater must had been
a Westlife fan). I convinced him to dual-boot Ubuntu, and just before I
became proud of myself for doing good deed, he messed up the
gnome-panel, and complained "why is that U-shitty-something you
installed ugly as hell"? Truth be told, Ubuntu was the first thing we
had ever disagree on.

For many years, I had never seen anybody but me use Linux. Sometimes, I
felt like an oasis, a wierdo. I told myself I'd be psyched if I've ever
seen one, which would have been... never.

## Ubuntu at Viettel

Today I went to a Viettel store. I usually come to the local one, a
massive one, where customers are not permitted to check stuff behind the
counter. The store I went to this morning was different, so I was
thrilled to see this:

HAVE YOU SEEN IT ?

I had a brief chat with the counter girl:

**ME**: Just out of curiosity, is the system you are using Ubuntu ?  (what a dumb question)

**COUNTER GIRL**: Ubun - what? I dunno, the tech-savvy guys from the IT department installed this.

**ME**: How long have you been using this ?

**COUNTER GIRL**: Hard to remember, I reckon two years.

**ME**: Do you know which version you are using ?  The counter girl shrugged, then commented: this
Windows has the taskbar on the left (I bet she implied the launcher).

Two things can be taken from this:

-   Ubuntu is ACTIVELY used in the wild world !
-   The newbie loves Unity ;)

## Rocking with Ubuntu since 2010 !

Back in 2009, I read countless of articles claiming the public sector
was move toward open source applications, as a solution to operation
cost, when the Global Financial Crisis started striking them real hard.
Admittedly, I was rather skeptical, as much as I doubt the government
when they propagandised how well national transportation has become in
the recent years, while the construction of the main road where I live
should have been completed by 2007. The fact that Viettel actively
utilises Ubuntu indicates how deep Ubuntu has integrated into the
Vietnam public sector, and they actually endeavour to save money. In
fact, **[Viettel claimed to saved 24 billion Dongs in
2010](http://www.thongtincongnghe.com/article/16494)**, thanks to
utilising Open Source software instead. On top of that, Viettel does
[apply the project on a national
scale](http://ubuntuone.com/6fF9E4ifnlcRL5Yklz6k25): by October, 2010,
Ubuntu has been installed on nearly **11000 clients**, amount for **40%
of the aggregate computers** (if you check out the link, you will see
they even use Ubuntu One to store the report :D)

*So yeah, next time if you have businesses to deal with at a Viettel
agency, do not forget to check the staff monitors !*
