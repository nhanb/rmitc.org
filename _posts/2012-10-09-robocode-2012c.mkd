You have heard about the rumors. Yes, Robocode is back this semester!

We
would like to invite all **B. IT lecturers, students and even alumni**
to join Robocode Tournament this semester 2012C. Sign up now and get
your robot ready by October 29nd, 2012 to join the fights. This would be
a great opportunity to have your hands on artificial intelligence,
practice some programming and, most important of all, to **HAVE FUN AND
MAKE NEW FRIENDS** at the beginning of this semester.

If you are asking
yourself "*What the heck is Robocode?*", please keep calm and go on
until the end of this post. Everything will be fine!

## What are the Prizes?

We offer prizes to the best *three robots* in the tournament.

-   *First prize*: 6 months of VIP subscription to
    [Viettorent.vn](http://viettorrent.vn/ "Viettorrent.vn")
-   *Second prize*: 3 months of VIP subscription
    to [Viettorent.vn](http://viettorrent.vn/ "Viettorrent.vn")
-   *Third prize*: 1 months of VIP subscription
    to [Viettorent.vn](http://viettorrent.vn/ "Viettorrent.vn")

Beside the above prizes, did I mention that
**our lectures are also in this tournament**? This is a great chance for you to
"beat up" your
lecturers. Show them what you're made of!

*Can you resist such prizes?*

## How to Sign Up?

Now that you are interested, or at least because of
the prizes. Signing up for this tournament is super simple. Please
follow this
[Google Form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFlzWDlCTzZEVVJEZU5Kb0RWTzV3Qnc6MQ)
and
fill in any necessary information.

The deadline for signing up is
**12:59pm - Wednesday, October 24th 2012**. Remember, that is the
deadline for signing up only. You can submit your robot any time by 4
hours before match time. (see below)

## How about the Rules?

Just
like any other competitions, there are some rules that you have to
follow to ensure the fairness of the tournament and to make our lives,
the organizers, a bit easier. Don't worry though, the rules are very
simple!

*1. Procedure:*

**a**. You must sign up before the deadline

**b**. You must email robot to the Organizational Leader
(s3312335@rmit.edu.vn) at least 4 hours before the match. This means you
have to submit your robot 2 times: on Friendly Match day, and Final
Death-match day.

*2. Robots:*

**a**. We encourage you to do some research to learn and come up with
your own algorithm for your robot.

**b**. It is ok to use some or modify other robots' source code, but
remember to give reference to the code that you use (reference can be
just as simple as a URL link to where to get the code).

**c.** It is NOT COOL to use other people's work without acknowledging
them and we consider this as CHEATING. Cheaters will be immediately
kicked out of the tournament.

**d.** You must include a readme.txt file when submitting your robot to
give reference if you use someone's code in your robot. Feel free to add
in any other information that you think necessary.

*3. Match:*

**a.** There will be 2 match days:

-   Friendly Match Day: Oct 29th, 2012 (Just friendly matches to see how
    your robot performs, NO SCORE given on demo matches).
-   Final Death-Match Day: Nov 3rd, 2012 (This is the real deal. Give
    them your best shot and become the champ).

**b.** 1 VS 1 Battle.

**c.** 1000 x 1000 Battlefield.

**d.** Crashed robots will be disqualified.

**e.** Game speed will be set at 30 (default speed). If a match exceeds
1.5 minutes, have to speed up (won't affect the final results at all).

**f.** Robocode will automatically determine the winner at the end of
each match (If you're interested to see how Robocode scores your robot,
click [here](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/Scoring)).

**g.** All disputes are resolved by the judges.

**h.** You will earn 3 points for each win, 1 for each draw, and 0 for
each loss.

**j.** The ones with the highest points will get the prizes.
