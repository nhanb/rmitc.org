Did you enjoy the Gameloft Industrial tour??? The tour was interesting, wasn't it? If you have
already had your own plan to work in the game industry, Gameloft may be one of the great choices
for you. After taking the tour around Gameloft, watching how its employees worked, talking directly
to many people there and listening to them sharing their experience, we, the RMIT ITers, have
collected many useful information in preparation for our future job.

Moreover, the friendly employees there also helped us know about the important role of programmers
(our job) in developing mobile games, especially the smartphone ones. The first thing we explored
at Gameloft was the professional working environment of a big company. English is the main language
and the only language allowed in working time. It's used for communicating between Vietnamese as
well as foreign people. We as the RMIT students found it very suitable for us because we have
already studied in an English environment. Next, there was nobody who worked alone at Gameloft.
Everyone has to work in team. This improves their soft skill and prevent the employee to be
isolated from the company community. Lastly, what we feel the most impressive is that Gameloft's
employees also have their own relax area, where they can play video games or take a rest and
continue working efficiently.

Surprisingly, Gameloft Vietnam is the largest studio of Gameloft all over the world. It takes the
responsibility in almost every phase in developing a game including designing, coding and testing.
The process is flexibly managed by the project leader and allocated to suitable team member. After
finishing development, the game is sent to Gameloft's headquarter and distributed to users. In the
tour, we also had the change to play and investigate some of the games from Gameloft Vietnam. These
games include Asphalt 6, Block Breaker and Shark Dash. We were also given many devices to test
those games, from the very low end feature phones to those newest high end devices like iPhone,
iPad or the new Nokia Lumia one.  Before we left, we had taken many photos with Gameloft employees
and receive some memorable gift from them.
