## What can GooSync do ?

Being a online service, GooSync enables non-Droids to seamlessly synchronised with Google Contacts,
Calendar, and Tasks. The great thing about  GooSync is it virtually WORKS WITH ALMOST EVERY PHONES
out there.  Nokia Indestructible series: approved, LG cheap retro touchscreen phones: approved. To
sum up: Blackberry OS, Symbian S60, S80, UIQ, Nokia s40, Sony Ericsson feature OS... basically
anything that has internet connection are approved ! For a complete list of compatible devices:

If auto sync is what you want, go for the premium service which worths Â£19.95, just like a Droid.
Otherwise, the 7-day trial period is enough to download the calendar, contacts and tasks for once.
