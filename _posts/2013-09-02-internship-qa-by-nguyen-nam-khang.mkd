*TL;DR:* Just send your questions regarding internship to khang[at]cogini[dot]com. His answers will
be posted here. If you're an IT student at RMIT Vietnam, you've probably heard of him.  Otherwise,
you've probably heard of him too. You know, the recent news buzz about some RMIT IT graduate with
the perfect 4.0 score? No? Okay, here's a summary for those who missed out:

-   He was the first president of IT Club.
-   He worked on [MultiUni](https://www.facebook.com/multiuni) - a non-profit project to bring
    updated, practical knowledge to the masses.
-   He graduated with a sweet 4/4 score.
-   He worked at Cogini Hong Kong for his internship then managed to
    [pull a branch to Vietnam](https://www.facebook.com/CoginiVietnam) where he's the chef
    representative.
-   Recently he [got some news coverage](http://vnexpress.net/tin-tuc/xa-hoi/nhip-dieu-tre/thanh-tich-dang-ne-cua-anh-chang-me-it-2834058.html),
    and got [an article of his own](http://www.rmit.edu.vn/profiles/alumni/nguyen-nam-khang) on
    RMIT's site.

Now considering the fact that many of us students are going on internships soon, Khang has agreed
to host an online Q&A event where he answers all of your concerns about internships. Simply **email
your questions to _khang[at]cogini[dot]com_**. All of his answers will be updated on this very
post. He will keep answering until the end of September, so take all the time you need to think
about what bothers you most on your first step to a professional career. What are you waiting for?
Fire up your email client and bombard him with everything you've got! :)

*the following are the questions and his answers*

## Q: Should I choose an enterprise or a startup?

I choose this to be the first question to answer because I
can tightly relate to it, back when I was preparing for my internship.
Unfortunately, with all the small talks and experience I have collected,
this is the type of question you have to look inside yourself to find an
answer.

An enterprise is an established business. It has a stable
business model, long-term business partners and sufficient resources to
overcome market glitches. Being able to survive in the ferocious
industry is an indicator that an enterprise knows a lot of things and
has done a number of things right. Derived from that experience are a
number of methodologies, policies and procedures that cover at the very
least core-business activities.

Joining an enterprise is a secured
career option. It is not very likely that the company will be out of
business in the matter of months, usually that happens over the course
of couple of years. Look at Nokia or BlackBarry for example. You will be
benefited from the experience of the company through various forms, e.g.
training, documentation and mentorship.

Your working environment is
likely to be more luxurious than that of your startup colleagues (though in
Vietnam and over the world, the gap is narrowing down). A standard
enterprise would provide you with hardware devices, free lunch, medical
care, social insurance coverage, Tet bonus and everything else that is
required by the labour law.

However, enterprises are no utopia. Due to
its size, an enterprise is structured in ways that make most of its
employees replaceable, even at manager level. A set of lego is my
favorite metaphor for this. The number of employees in an enterprise
might also be an issue. On one hand, your existence will be so
insignificant that no one would know if you were eaten by a lion
([good-old IBM joke](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/L/lion-food.html)).
On the other hand, you might get crushed under peer pressure. Unilever
is very notorious for this, every year it recruits hundreds of
management trainees and lets them fight till death.

Every enterprise
would have a handful of long-term partners, which provide a stable
source of income. But these long-lasting partnerships are placed on top
of legacy systems, developed, who knows, 20-30 years ago. For example,
Cobol is a very ancient programming language, which was responsible for
the infamous Y2K. By the time I took my internship in 2010, CSC was
still known for providing technical support to such systems.

Compared to
enterprises, startups are on the other extreme. Startups are on hype all
over the world. Everyone talks about it. Startups attracts a lot of
talents because it gives people a chance to visualize their own universe
where imagination is the only limits. For anything you do, there might
be a chance that you are the first one ever set out to do it, solving a
unique problem for mankind. Oh Jesus Chris, the feeling that you are
pushing the edge of the world, that is good.

For experienced developers,
startups hit a sweet spot when bureaucratic policies are replaced by the
freedom to establish new standards. If you noticed, most of the new
things in software industry came from startups, e.g Agile for
methodology or RoR for development.

Last but not least startups have
been making countless founders and core-members millionaires. When
Instagram was acquired with ONE-BILLION USD, it had around 12 members,
effectively everyone of them can have their own yacht and island now.

However, startup is a risky path. For every successful startup, 99 others
fails. The working environment and benefit package in most of startups
are every limited. Many founders and startup employees live on minimum
wage or below until the business takes off, or fail miserably. Oh hey,
but too much funding in an early stage can kill a startup too
([Color](http://www.businessinsider.com/color-employees-lost-apple-millions-lala-bill-nguyen-2013-1) of
Bill Nguyen,
or [Skunkworks](http://www.techinasia.com/skunkworks-shutting-rebooting/) right
in Vietnam are bold examples).

Working in a startup is very stressful.
It is a common belief that if you are working less than 100h/week, your
startup is not going to succeed and investors won't be convinced. While
it sure feels good pushing the edge of the world, the same situation
could be described as crawling in the dark if you failed, lost your
direction and had no idea where  you were heading to.

There are pros and
cons, and learning opportunities in both enterprises and startups. And
always remember that this is just an internship. You can fail, you can
make a bad choice **and you should**. What is the worst thing that can
happen? You wasted 4 months of your life in a crappy company. But that
experience, either sweet or leaves a bad taste, is priceless. He who
never fails never succeeds. "You can't connect the dots looking forward;
you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that
the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in
something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has
never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life." Steve
Jobs, 2005.


## Q: Should I apply for a paid or unpaid internship? If it is a paid internship, what is a good offer?

An offer in a job, not only an internship, is the mutual
commitment between employer and employee. By providing benefit packages
and working environment stated in the offer, an employer has the right
to expect its employee to legally hold responsibility for his work.

Being paid in an internship is not only an indicator that you are
valuable to your employer but also a call for **your professionalism in
being responsible for your impact to the organization performance**. In
RMIT's official internship agreement, it is stated that monthly
allowance is optional. This is a move of the university to lower the
entry barrier for some students who have not yet been excellent in their
profession (the word "monthly allowance" itself is also to lower the
barrier as it indicates that a legal contract is not required).

Based on
my pure assumption, students who are concerned about paid/unpaid
internship are ones that haven't got any previous experience in the
industry. And by considering unpaid internship, students are trying to
reduce the pressure they are about to face during the internship. That
seems to be a reasonable option, but **if you are serious about your
career, I suggest not to**. An unpaid position is an open message from
the organization that your work, not matter how good or bad, is not
going to matter, it doesn't provide value to the organization, it is
junk. You have spent a little fortune for your education, you better
work on something matters. And this is kinda just for fun but receiving
a paycheck after all of the hard work is part of the internship
experience too.

Talking about offer, it is important to acknowledge that
salary is a small part of an offer. For an internship, that portion is
especially small. Ultimately  what an organization has to provide is its
working environment, corporation culture and other experience coming
along. A few items to notice when considering offers would include

-   The culture the organization is embracing. Refer to the first
    question to know which type of company fits your taste.
-   The people you are working with. Sometimes, it doesn't matter what
    you do, it is who you do it with. An offer receives its incremental
    value if it comes from an organization where employees are
    top-notches in particular fields in the industry. Working with these
    gurus is an priceless experience (which might not always be
    positive, I know a handful of gurus who are truly sore losers). And
    the fact that they are gathering is one place is kinda an indicator
    on its own already.
-   The type of projects you are going to work with. Is that some kind
    of project that you can freely write about in your school report or
    is it something you have to sign Non Disclosure Agreement (whether
    or not you pass the "course" depends on the quality of your reports,
    it is an important piece)? Is that the type of project you want to
    work on in the next few years? How do those projects align with your
    personal development?
-   What are the growth opportunities the company provides? Do them
    align with your goals in the next few years?
-   And finally salary, aka monthly allowance. As stated earlier, I
    suggest taking a paid internship rather than an unpaid one. The
    salary should be sufficient for you to live on it independently.
    Given the current state of the market, a salary of \$300-700 is
    considered well-paid. You can refer to [this
    survey](http://www.robertwalters.com.vn/wwwmedialibrary/WWW2/country/vietnam/content/salary-survey/vietnam-salary-survey-2013.pdf)
    to get a sense of what is going on in the industry.
    -   Don't jump into the conclusion that a salary is low or high with
        just the number. As an intern, there is a chance that you won't
        be productive in the first few months (read, your entire
        internship) and that your salary together with other benefits
        you are receiving are nothing but cost to the company. Investing
        in an intern is usually a long-term investment, and no
        fool places all eggs in one basket. Carefully consider what you
        are receiving in big picture, not just a paycheck.
    -   Many companies pay its interns the same amount as entry-level
        employee. It might mean that the company has a deep pocket. But
        it is more likely that the company doesn't provide any special
        training/treatment to interns and technically you \*are\* a
        normal employee under the eyes of your direct boss (monetary
        award is mutually commitment between two parties, remember?).
        This does not necessarily mean good or bad, just something as a
        green horn you should look out for.

## Q: How can I find an internship abroad?

Hard work and a lot of luck.

Firstly you should know that you are competing
with a lot of native students whose education is tailored for the need
of the local market. If your language is not fluent, your CV is not
shiny, you have little to no working experience and all you have is a
cold contact, your chance to win this competition is extremely slim. The
interview processes of different companies are quite identical and if
you have been attending WPP workshop, you should know about the art of
answering interview questions better that I do now :) So in this answer,
I will only focus on the parts before the interview.

**Spend time on it,
decently.** There is no place for luck in this competition. It is not
luck that brings you a reference to an overseas internship, it is years
of hard work for a nice transcript and reputation among fellow students.
It is not luck that your CV passes the screening step, a decent and
well-written CV does. And little can luck help to boost your English for
an interview, on phone. Furthermore the whole visa a truly a pain in
butt. Internship visa is especially troublesome. In many countries, the
only visa types that are available are Resident, Work and Visitor visa.
Work visa are for professional only and there is a quota on how many
expats a company can employ. Visitor visa usually lasts for only 1 month
for Vietnamese citizen and visa bearer can't be employed (legally). Due
to its nature, this is something you need to discuss and coordinate
closely with your employer. It can easily eat up 2 months of your time,
and if it mixes up with exam period, ain't gonna be nice.

**Choose a
company.** All companies expect long-term value  from investments they
make. A fact you should know is that in RMIT Melbourne, there are many
Vietnamese students who can't find an internship over there and have to
reluctantly travel back to Vietnam for an employment opportunity. The
reason is that companies are concerned about the work permit for the
student once his/her education in Australia is over. Compared to native
students who speak a faultless language and have no problem with visa,
investing in a Vietnamese student is too risky. Same logic applies when
you are seeking for an internship overseas. However, there are two types
of companies where being a Vietnamese engineer is an advantage. Firstly,
those are companies looking at Vietnam as a potential business partner.
The purposes can be various, ranging from extending market to talent
acquisition. These companies are in great need to understand about from
multiple aspects and a Vietnamese employee is an useful resource. The
second type are young (relatively) technology giants, like Google,
Facebook or Twitter. These companies succeeded in the new waves of
technology and greatly appreciate the power of diversity. They are
always try to balance the demographics of employees. When you look into
companies of this type, the company size matters. Acquiring visa that
permits work in most countries is are troublesome and time consuming
process. Unless the company is big enough to have its own legal
department, most will pass the burden.

**Get a reference.** From my
experience in recruitment, most companies value hiring opportunities
coming from its internal network, aka word-of-mouth reference. So once
you have a good idea which company you want to apply to, you need to
approach the company from different direction, and as soon as possible.
You can approach the company HR's via social network such as LinkedIn.
If your LinkedIn profile is attractive, you will receive many offers,
good and bad ones. This might not be common in Vietnam (yet), but quite
popular in neighbor countries, like Singapore. Even more effective, you
approach the company's employee through open source project. I really
love this approach because not only you gain a valuable internal
reference, your application profile can also be pre-filtered. Similarly
approach the group of Vietnamese people working in the company :).
Lastly approach the company through developer group, competition and
event held by the company. There is actually one last approach which is
to become excellent in the field the company is starving for talents,
but that is quite hard for students so I don't really want to stress on.
I assume I should talk about closing an offer as well. But wait, if you
are a bright student, you have been studying hard and now you are
getting an overseas internship, it is no time for QnA, it is time for
party \\m/ So perhaps another time, or you can always email me :)
