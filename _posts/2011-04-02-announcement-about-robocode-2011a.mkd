> **The Robocode Tournament 2011A has been delayed.**
Regarding to the
Robocode Tournament 2011A, for a number of unwanted reasons, this
Tournament cannot be organised this semester and has been delayed until
next sem (2011B).

IT Club gives our truly apology to anyone who spent
their time organising this event and to any player who has been told and
want to participate in this competition. Hope that could see everybody
soon next semester :).

**---**  
Please note that semester 2011B starts at
20th, June.
