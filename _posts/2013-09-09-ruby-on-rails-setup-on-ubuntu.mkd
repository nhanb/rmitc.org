## Installing RVM

**[RVM](https://rvm.io/)** is a **R**uby **V**ersion **M**anager created by Wayne E. Seguin to ease
the process of installing and managing many different versions of Ruby and gem sets on a single
machine. Installing RVM is easy and we have a lot of options to do it (please refer to its
installation documentation for more details). However, with the ruby or rails option included, the
installation command will automatically install the latest Ruby or Rails version. Unfortunately,
the most recent version of Ruby and Rails is largely different from the previous one and may cause
problems to developers along the way. Thus we recommend installing the old version of Ruby on
Rails. To start, you need to open a terminal (gnome-terminal, shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+T), call **curl**
to download the script and then **bash** to install it, all in 1 command:

```bash
$ \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable -auto
```

The RVM environment is now added into .bash\_profile file in your home directory, you need to load
the environment by closing and reopening the terminal, or using the command:

```bash
$ . ~/.bash_profile
```

Last step is to install all system requirements for RVM to use, with only 1 command: `rvm
requirements` If you are prompted for a password, just enter your account password and everything
will be done automatically. That's easy, right?

## Installing Ruby and Rails

With RVM installed, you are ready to install Ruby on Rails. Now, this is the best part. Guess what?
You only need 1 command for installing Ruby and 1 command for installing Rails. "Thank you very
much Mr. Wayne!" On a terminal, enter this command to install Ruby (of version 1.9.3, latest of
1.x.x): `rvm install 1.9.3` Want to check if installation is successful or not? Use this to see
current version of Ruby: `ruby -v` Now for Rails (version 3.2.13, latest of 3.x.x), we do: `gem
install rails -v 3.2.13` As mysql2 and pg (for MySQL and PostgreSQL databases), are 2 most common
used database gems, you may want to install it at this early stage. If so, enter these 2 commands
in terminal: `gem install mysql2` `gem install pg` Congratulations! You are now cool to begin
developing you very first Ruby on Rails applications.

## Installing PostgreSQL and MySQL

As mentioned above, (instead of SQLite,) you may need to use PostgreSQL and MySQL many times in the
future for serious development. Thus, we present you the instructions to install those servers on
your machine.

### PostgreSQL

To install [PostgreSQL](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL) server, use the following
commands: `sudo apt-get install postgresql` `sudo apt-get install postgresql-contrib` You may need
[pgAdmin III](http://www.pgadmin.org/) (a GUI management tool) to easily manage your server and
databases: `sudo apt-get install pgadmin3` Now, you need to setup a password for your server. Use
the following command to access *psql* interface for *postgres* database with *postgres* account
(default username for your server): `sudo -u postgres psql postgres` Enter this command and provide
your password of choice: `\password postgres` Now, exit *psql* interface with command **\\q** and
re-enter it: `sudo -u postgres psql` Then install *adminpack* extension: `CREATE EXTENSION
adminpack;` And your PostgreSQL is ready for service.  Please use the postgres username with the
password you chose for your Rails applications!

### MySQL

Installing [MySQL](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/mysql.html) is even easier, you just
need to enter this command in terminal: `sudo apt-get install mysql-server` And there will be a
script doing everything automatically for you. All you need to do is providing it with password for
the *root* account of the server. Now you can develop Rails applications with *mysql2* gem. Just
remember to use root as username and the password is the password you entered in the installation!
For managing, you may need to use the popular GUI tool named [MySQL
Workbench](http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/).

## Beyond the scope

All basic stuff has been installed. "Now what?" You may pick a favorite editor and start developing
some Rails projects. "But what types of editor can I use?" It depends on your interest and
professional level:

-   For ease of development, you can use an IDE, such as Eclipse with a Ruby/Rails plugin or Aptana
    Studio.
-   For friendly look and better feel, you can use Textmate or
    [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) (can be installed with [Ubuntu Tweak](http://ubuntu-tweak.com/)
-   For ergonomic design (and maybe looking professional), you can use Vim (with support of many
    plugins, like rails.vim and snippets.vim).

For modeling PostgreSQL database, you can use [pgModeler](http://www.pgmodeler.com.br/). There are
a ton of great tools out there in the real world. You can always search for a collection of them
that best fit your style and the projects you work on. That's all we want to show you for your very
first steps. Good luck on your Ruby on Rails journey and gem adventure!
