# rmitc.org [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rmitc/rmitc.org.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rmitc/rmitc.org)

Source files for RMIT Vietnam IT Club's [official website][1] (we haven't migrated yet).

# What the hell is this?

We use [jekyll][2] to generate HTML from markdown files. New commits in the **master** branch will
be built by [travis-ci][3]. If nothing goes wrong, the generated HTML will be pushed to our
deployment repo at [https://github.com/rmitc/rmitc.github.io][4], where GitHub Pages will host our
website at **rmitc.org**.

Basically everything is open source and free... except for the domain.

# Whoa, what a bunch of cheapskates!

Not really. Although running all on free services is a huge plus, our main goal is to demonstrate
that great things can be done based on software and infrastructure powered by the open source
community.
